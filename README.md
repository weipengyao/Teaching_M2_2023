# Teaching_M2_2023
Materials used in the teaching of **Numerical Methods** for the Master 2 students at Sorbonne University during academic year 2023-2024

### Lecture 01-02
Based on **Kinetic Simulation of Plasmas using Particle-in-cell (PIC) code** [by Anna Grassi, Mickael Grech]

- implement the particle pusher using the Boris algorithm [J. P. Boris, Proc. Fourth Conf. Num. Sim. Plasmas 3-67 (1970)]
  - gyro-motion
  - ExB drift
  - magnetic reconnection
  - relativistic regime
  - energy conservation


- Electromagnetic fields propagation via Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method [A. Taflove, Computation electrodynamics: The finite-difference time-domain method, 3rd Ed. (2005)]

  - boundary conditions [Mur, Gerrit. "Absorbing boundary conditions for the finite-difference approximation of the time-domain electromagnetic-field equations." IEEE transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility 4 (1981): 377-382.]
  - source terms with only E vs. both E and B
  - vectorization the for-loops

### Lecture 03
Landau damping of Langmuir waves with **SMILEI**
